## Controls

Controller use supported. Left and right to move and spacebar (or Y for controller users) to jump.

## Notes

This platformer takes advantage of the new Unity tile map system. The goal of this project was to
become familiar with how Unity handles tilemap usage and creation in the scope of a 2D platformer.
